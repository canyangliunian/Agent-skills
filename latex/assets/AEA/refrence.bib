  abstract = {This paper assesses whether cities enhance the technical efficiency of nearby rural counties by allowing for heterogeneous urban effects both by region and city type. An empirical application is demonstrated using the Chinese county-level agricultural data from 2005 to 2009. We find that urban proximity significantly enhances efficiency in the Eastern region, while its effect is lower and less significant for the Central region and not significant at all for the Western region. In addition, urban effects vary across the urban hierarchy. We find that provincial-level cities have a deteriorating impact on technical efficiency, while lower-level cities enhance technical efficiency in most regions. Implications of these findings in terms of urban and regional planning are discussed.},

County-level minimum wage data is combined with recent proprietary household survey data representative of China's ethnically diverse areas. The identification strategy relies on an unconditional quantile regression framework that takes into account policy endogeneity using an instrument variable approach. The findings show that minimum wages lead to wage compression along the bottom and middle parts of the urban wage distribution. The minimum wage effects are larger for lower-skilled workers located in ethnic minority counties or that belong to an ethnic minority group. Counterfactual analysis further shows that minimum wages help to significantly reduce aggregate urban wage inequality: increasing minimum wages from a counterfactual benchmark to their observed levels, an average increase of 26\%, reduces the Gini coefficient of wages by 10--12\%.},

It is the combined result of the state's devolution of governance responsibilities and competitive-minded local cadres' interests in benefits associated with scaling up.

  abstract = {As a novel agricultural organization model, agro-industrial clusters have emerged as a new engine driving the growth of the agricultural economy. In contrast to existing research that concentrates on a single aspect of the core agricultural sector, this study innovatively includes related agricultural industries in the measurement scope from an industrial-chain perspective, thereby enhancing the precision of measuring agro-industrial clusters. Meanwhile, using the panel data of 1467 counties in China from 2013 to 2020, this study employs the two-stage least squares method to examine the impact of agro-industrial clusters on agricultural TFP and its underlying mechanism, effectively addressing endogeneity issues. The findings indicate that agro-industrial clusters significantly contribute to the enhancement of agricultural TFP. Nevertheless, this effect is more pronounced in regions characterized by abundant human capital, high financial resources, low environmental pollution, and characteristic agricultural industry resources. Moreover, a "Matthew Effect" is observed in the impact of agro-industrial clusters on agricultural TFP; specifically, regions with higher levels of agricultural TFP experience a more substantial positive influence from these clusters. Regarding the mechanisms, agro-industrial clusters can boost agricultural TFP through facilitating the transfer of rural labor and attracting industrial and commercial capital to the countryside. Further spatial econometric analysis reveals that agro-industrial clusters not only enhance the agricultural TFP of the local area but also generate significant spatial spillover effects, thereby facilitating the improvement of agricultural TFP in neighboring regions. This study offers theoretical support for advancing the implementation of China's advantageous and characteristic industrial cluster policy and presents novel insights for developing countries to explore approaches to enhancing agricultural TFP.},

Highways between major cities pass through some counties but not others. Based on this difference in counties' access to highways, we conduct a difference-in-difference propensity score matching estimation, with the treatment variables being counties' highway connection status and their industrial performance before and after being connected to a highway. We find that highways promote industrial development in counties with higher output and greater investment levels. Moreover, highways have differential impacts across industries and regions.

By identifying expressway accessibility through toll station locations, we estimate the manufacturing distribution along expressways for 2001--2005. We find that expressway accessibility promotes manufacturing employment for inland counties by around 41 percent; however, for coastal counties that already have high road density and dense manufacturing layouts, the returns from new expressways are small. Furthermore, counties close to large cities benefit more from expressway accessibility than do counties that are far from them. The gap first increases in the period of expressway construction and then decreases as expressway effects are smoothed.},

Based on the distribution patterns of rural credit cooperatives in about 2200 counties in 2009, this paper examines two aspects of financial exclusion in rural China after the restructuring of the banking industry. Despite the state's efforts to ensure financial inclusion in rural areas, poor farmers could be spatially included while still being denied loans due to their inability to provide collateral, and the lack of formal credit records. The mismatch between the supply and demand of credit has led to informal loans substituting for formal loans and thus contributed to the proliferation of informal banking in China.},

Using a novel dataset of 20,205 newly established firms in the Chinese manufacturing sector from 2007 to 2014, our production function estimates suggest the existence of a sizable gap (averaging 50 USD/m2) between the marginal productivity of land and its user cost. Basic economic theory suggests a possible relationship with China's minimum investment intensity (MII) regulation. An analysis using changes in MII limits over time and the resulting discontinuities at county borders confirms that larger gaps are significantly associated with increases in MII limits. Thus, the results of this study suggest that MII regulation leads to allocative inefficiency of land.},

However, Western-centric urban theories and studies of spatial inequality have not paid sufficient attention to the connection between income divergence and urban expansion. This paper employed a panel quantile regression model to investigate this relationship in 220 prefecture-level Chinese cities in 2006--2014. To identify potential spatiotemporal effects, we conducted additional robustness checks using the spatial Durbin model and geographical and temporal weighted regression. The results show that a 1 \% expansion of urban land decreases the urban--rural income gap by 0.005 \% to 0.011 \%. This narrowing effect is particularly prominent in the eastern and central regions and in areas that are less urbanized overall. It also varies within regions that have a more pronounced difference between the lowest and highest quantiles in northeastern China and cities with urbanization rates of {$>$}50 \%. Finally, we find evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between urban expansion and the urban--rural income gap. Our results entail suggestions for improved urban--rural development policies aimed toward greater integration and efficiency in urban expansion.},
